## My thoughts:

I found an interesting article on the application of AI and ML in software testing. It discussed how the integration of AI in software testing elicits both positive and negative reactions, with some being skeptical of its ability to perform tasks as well as humans and others worried about their job security. However, the article also stated that AI is here to stay and can be beneficial in terms of speed and efficiency. It emphasized that AI bots are not coming to take our jobs but instead they will be a useful tool in software testing, working in tandem with humans to provide faster, more efficient results. The article explained that there are three stages of AI in software testing: operational, process, and systemic. Currently, most AI-enabled software testing is performed at the operational stage with process AI being more mature. The article concludes by saying that setting clear goals and expectations is crucial for successful implementation of AI in software testing.
